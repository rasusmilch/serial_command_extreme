## How it Works
The **SerialCommandCoordinator** maps serial string commands to function addresses without using the heap, making it ideal for memory-constrained environments like the ATmega328P. 

Unlike previous versions that relied on dynamic memory, this revamped library uses **C++ Templates** to allocate command lists and buffers statically at compile-time. Command strings are stored directly in **Program Memory (Flash)** using the `F()` macro, ensuring that SRAM is preserved for your application logic. The library operates using a non-blocking state machine, allowing your main loop to continue running while serial data is being gathered.

## How to Use It
### Main Workflow
1. **Initialize**: Declare the object as a template. You can specify the maximum number of commands and the buffer size, or use the optimized defaults.
2. **Register**: Map string literals (in Flash) to `void` functions.
3. **Update**: Call `update()` in your main loop to automatically handle input and execution.

```cpp
#include <SerialCommandCoordinator.h>

// Initialize with defaults: 8 commands, 32-byte buffer
SerialCommandCoordinator<> scc(Serial);

void performLampTest() {
  // code to turn on and off lamp
}

void scaleTest() {
  // code to check scale values
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  
  // Register commands using the F() macro to save SRAM
  scc.registerCommand(F("lampTest"), &performLampTest);
  scc.registerCommand(F("scaleTest"), &scaleTest);
}

void loop() {
  // Non-blocking update: checks serial and runs commands automatically
  scc.update();
  
  // Your other application code runs freely here
}
```

### Breaking Out of Loops
When a registered function initiates a persistent execution loop (e.g., a continuous sensor polling routine), it occupies the processor's execution context, preventing the primary `SerialCommandCoordinator::update()` cycle from monitoring the serial stream. To maintain interactivity without exiting the local scope, the `checkForBreak()` method enables the function to perform a non-blocking poll of the serial buffer for a specific termination signal.

```cpp
void scaleTest() {
  Serial.println(F("Scale Test active. Press '!' to stop."));
  
  while (true) {
    // Perform diagnostic work
    printScaleData();

    // Check for the break character (default is '!')
    if (scc.checkForBreak()) {
      Serial.println(F("Exiting Test..."));
      return; // Jumps back to scc.update() in the main loop
    }
  }
}
```

### Passing Parameters
To maintain a minimal memory footprint, the library provides a command-length agnostic method for retrieving arguments. The getParam() method scans the internal buffer for the first space delimiter and returns a zero-copy pointer to the start of the parameter payload.

```cpp
void setMotorSpeed() {
  // Automatically locates the data following the command
  const char* param = scc.getParam();
  
  if (param != nullptr) {
    int speed = atoi(param);
    analogWrite(MOTOR_PIN, speed);
    
    Serial.print(F("Motor speed set to: "));
    Serial.println(speed);
  } else {
    Serial.println(F("Error: No parameter provided."));
  }
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  scc.registerCommand(F("speed"), &setMotorSpeed);
}
```

### Interactive Sub-Modules
For complex diagnostics like sensor calibration or manual motor stepping, you can enter a dedicated execution loop. This allows the system to process single-character instructions instantly.

> Note: Do not use getParam() inside a persistent while loop. Because getParam() relies on the internal buffer populated by the main update() cycle, calling it within a local loop will result in a logic spinlock, where the function reads stale data indefinitely. For real-time interactivity, use readChar().

```cpp
void manualStepMode() {
  Serial.println(F("Manual Mode: [+] Forward, [-] Backward, [!] Exit"));
  
  while (true) {
    // 1. Check for the template-defined break character ('!')
    if (scc.checkForBreak()) {
      Serial.println(F("Exiting..."));
      return; 
    }

    // 2. Use readChar() for real-time stream interaction
    char input = scc.readChar();
    
    if (input == '+') {
      stepMotor(1);
    } else if (input == '-') {
      stepMotor(-1);
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Initialization
Because this is a template-based library, you can customize the memory footprint based on your specific hardware needs without editing the library source as well as the loop break character and serial end marker:
```cpp
// Default: 8 commands, 32-byte buffer, '!' break, '\n' end
SerialCommandCoordinator<> scc(Serial); 

// Custom sizing: 12 commands, 64-byte buffer
SerialCommandCoordinator<12, 64> scc(Serial);

// Full protocol override: 10 commands, 32-byte buffer, q break, CR end marker
SerialCommandCoordinator<10, 32, 'q', '\r'> scc(Serial);
```

## Considerations
### Zero-Heap Allocation
This library has been re-designed to eliminate malloc, free, and calloc. All arrays are fixed-size and allocated in the Static Data section of the RAM. This prevents runtime crashes due to heap fragmentation and allows the compiler to provide accurate memory usage reports during the build process.

### Non-Blocking & Overflow Protection
The library no longer uses delay() or timing-based reads. It features a Discarding State: if an incoming command exceeds the defined BUFFER_SIZE, the utility enters a non-blocking "ignore" mode until the next newline is reached. This protects the system from processing "garbage" data without halting your program.

### Flash Memory (PROGMEM)
To maximize SRAM efficiency on 8-bit AVR boards, all registered command strings are stored in Flash. This is why the F() macro is required during registration. On 32-bit boards (ESP32, ARM), the library automatically aliases to compatible types, maintaining a unified codebase.

## CI Testing
This library uses a two-stage CI/CD pipeline to verify logic across multiple architectures.

### Compilation Matrix
The code is compiled against the following to verify the "Zero-SRAM" footprint and handle 16-bit vs 32-bit word size differences:

* AVR (8-bit): Uno (ATmega328P), Mega 2560.
* ESP32 (32-bit): Xtensa and RISC-V cores.
* ARM (32-bit): SAMD21 (Cortex-M0+).

### Functional Simulation ([EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino))
We leverage Host-Side Testing (compiling natively for Linux via EpoxyDuino) to validate the core library logic at maximum velocity. This stage bypasses hardware emulation to focus on:

* **Command Parsing**: Callback execution and parameter extraction.
* **Sub-mode Logic**: Real-time polling via readChar() in sub-routines.
* **Buffer Safety**: Automatic recovery after input exceeds the 64-byte limit.
* **Line-Endings**: Compatibility with both Unix (\n) and Windows (\r\n) terminators.
